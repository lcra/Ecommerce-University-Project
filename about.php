        <p>
        Created in 1729 BC, Group 16 supplied the Hykos people with robes. <br><br>
        
        It is rumored that without the robes provided by Group 16, the Hykos people would have not been victorious in their attempt to conquer Egypt. Fanatics tribute the Hykos success to the baboon leather used by Group 16 which created a thick protective layer.
